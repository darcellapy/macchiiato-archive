A scrapped project of mine that would have been a custom website that you would load on the TVii applet. The key point of it was to have the ability to order Domino's Pizza straight from it!

# Why was this scrapped?
Primarily due to a lack of motivation and security concerns. The code is also pretty messy, if not the entire way I did this project using Python with Flask probably is a very weird choice to make an unofficial Domino's Pizza ordering website for the Wii U that you would load on the TVii applet (I had no other option though because I'd rather do that than use JavaScript or make a full homebrew app because I have a certified skill issue ðŸ˜Ž).
